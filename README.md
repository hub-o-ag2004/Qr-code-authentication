QR Code Authentication: Detecting Original vs. Counterfeit Prints
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify QR codes as original (first print) or counterfeit (second print) using machine learning (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and deep learning (CNNs). The goal is to detect subtle differences caused by reprinting, such as resolution degradation, edge distortions, and microscopic patterns.

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains two classes of QR code images:

First Prints: Original QR codes with embedded copy detection patterns.

Second Prints: Counterfeit QR codes generated by scanning and reprinting originals.

📊 Features Extracted
The following features were engineered to capture QR code differences:
✅ Global Image Properties: Brightness, Contrast, Sharpness, Resolution
✅ Edge Features: Edge Pixel Count, Edge Density, Mean & Variance of Edge Intensity
✅ Texture Features: Harris Corner Detection, Hough Line Transform
✅ Frequency Features: Fourier Transform Analysis
✅ Statistical Features: Skewness, Kurtosis of Pixel Intensity

🖥️ Model Development
Two approaches were implemented:

1️⃣ Machine Learning Pipeline:

Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)

Random Forest Classifier (Best ML Model with 100% Accuracy)

2️⃣ Deep Learning Approach (CNNs):

3 Convolutional Layers + MaxPooling & Dropout

Trained using TensorFlow & Keras

📈 Model Performance
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Random Forest	100.0%	100.0%	100.0%	100.0%
CNN (Deep Learning)	90.0%	91.0%	90.0%	90.0%
✅ Random Forest outperformed CNN due to well-engineered feature extraction.
✅ CNN struggled with minor distortions but is scalable with Transfer Learning.
